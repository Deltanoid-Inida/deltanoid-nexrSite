App builds & starts

npm run build completes without errors.

npm start (or next start) serves the production build.

Commands: next build && next start (or your PM2/systemd start).

Basic navigation & routing

All static pages load (status 200).

Dynamic routes (e.g., /product/[id]) render for valid and invalid ids (404 for invalid).

Client-side navigation using next/link works (no full page reloads unless intended).

Test: click links, use browser back/forward.

Contact / lead forms & inputs

Required validation client + server.

Successful submit shows success message and stores/sends lead.

Failure shows friendly error and retry option.

Anti-spam: honeypot or reCAPTCHA present and effective.

API routes

All pages/api/* endpoints respond with expected status codes and payloads.

Validate both success and error responses.

Protect endpoints that require auth.

Authentication & session flows (if applicable)

Login, logout, token refresh, protected pages redirect to login.

Session expires and forces re-login.

SSG / SSR / ISR behavior

getStaticProps pages build with correct data.

getServerSideProps pages render on request (test with toggled server data).

ISR: revalidate works — updated content appears after revalidation interval.

Images

Next/Image loads correctly, no layout shift. Check priority and placeholder usage.

next/image produces properly sized images, avoids oversized images in HTML.

Performance (production build)

Lighthouse: Performance ≥ target (e.g., >90), LCP, FID/TBT, CLS within limits.

Bundle size: check next build output and next analyse or webpack-bundle-analyzer.

Remove large unused JS, defer non-critical scripts.

# High-priority checks (user experience & SEO)

SEO meta tags & HTTP headers

<title>, <meta name="description">, canonical, Open Graph & Twitter cards.

<link rel="canonical"> for duplicated content.

Server sends correct Content-Type, caching headers.

Structured data

JSON-LD valid for Organization/Product etc. (test with Google Rich Results test).

Sitemap & robots

/robots.txt and sitemap.xml present and accurate.

Accessibility (a11y)

Form labels, keyboard navigation, focus order, aria attributes.

Color contrast passes WCAG AA.

Run axe-core or Lighthouse accessibility audit.

Localization / i18n

Localized content loads, language switch persists.

next-i18next or Next's i18n routing works.

Social previews

Share links on WhatsApp / Twitter / LinkedIn show right OG image & text.

# Medium-priority checks (security, infra)

Security headers

Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy.

Environment variables

No secret env var exposed client-side (only NEXT_PUBLIC_ vars should be client-visible).

Rate limiting & abuse

Bruteforce protections for auth routes, rate-limits for public endpoints.

Dependency vulnerabilities

npm audit or pnpm audit and fix high-severity items.

# Low-priority / enhancements

Analytics & conversion tracking

GA4 or GTM events fire on important actions (contact form, signup).

Error logging

Sentry / LogRocket integration capture SSR and client errors.

Progressive enhancement

Site works with JS disabled for critical content (if required).

# Cross-browser & device matrix

Desktop: Chrome (latest), Firefox (latest), Safari (macOS latest), Edge.

Mobile: iOS Safari (real device), Android Chrome (real device).

Screen sizes: test common breakpoints and ensure no horizontal scroll or clipped buttons.
