# Deltanoid Starter (Next.js + Tailwind)
This is a lightweight starter scaffold for the Deltanoid website.
It includes the 8 pages we planned, a contact API, and an example AI endpoint.

## Features
- Next.js pages for: Home, Who We Are, What We Do, Our Work, Let's Talk, Insights, Testimonials, Careers
- Tailwind CSS ready (basic setup)
- Contact API endpoint (example using SendGrid)
- AI endpoint placeholder (calls OpenAI; set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in secrets)
- MDX-like simple data folder for Insights (Markdown files)

## Quick start (Replit)
1. Create a new Replit and choose **Node.js**. Upload this project or paste files.
2. Install packages: `npm install`
3. Create Replit secrets/environment variables:
   - SENDGRID_API_KEY (if using SendGrid)
   - SENDGRID_TO_EMAIL (where contact form forwards)
   - OPENAI_API_KEY (optional, for AI features)
4. Run: `npm run dev`
5. Open the Replit URL to preview the site.

## Notes
- This is a starter scaffold. Add your logos in `public/images/` and replace placeholder content.
- For production, we recommend deploying to Vercel and using a proper CMS (Sanity/Strapi) when the Insights hub grows.
